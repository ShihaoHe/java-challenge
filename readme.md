- secured the endpoint based on OAuth2 support of Spring
- added documentation to every class
- added global exception handler
- fixed three bugs, one is that update employee without setting id, that would be save not update, another one is that there wasn't @RequestBody for save-employee-endpoint, spring wouldn't construct that parameter, last one is that CRUD didn't use transactionfrom dev branch
